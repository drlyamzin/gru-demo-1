To fit the model, run "python demo1.py"

To examine fitting metrics on train and test sets, run "python error_analysis.py"

\models_by_epoch contains already fitted models (100 sequential epochs) on which error metrics could be run

Ready, document in more detail:

2. [X] Overview of predictions for a given epoch (as a dozen time vectors; as a cloud (precision/recall)
3. (2) across epochs

In Progress:

1. Make a video using a fitted model from specific epoch, save with specific name
5. across models: tensorboard will be very useful


4. Tensorboard integration: 

several metrics on the same plot: consult this -- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47877475/keras-tensorboard-plot-train-and-validation-scalars-in-a-same-figure/48393723

save accuracy and/or tp,fp for use in tensorboard
